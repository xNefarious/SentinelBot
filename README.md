## Summary

SentinelBot is an AI-powered moderation tool designed to detect hateful, manipulative, or predatory messages across social platforms. It helps protect users—especially younger and older individuals—by identifying harmful content in real time and alerting them to scams, grooming, or abuse. The system can be used as a browser extension, API, or platform integration, and classifies messages using NLP, sentiment analysis, and intent detection.

## Project

### Project Name: SentinelBot
Brief Description: SentinelBot is an AI-powered moderation tool designed to detect and take action against hateful, manipulative, or predatory messages on social media. It helps protect vulnerable users by identifying harmful content and alerting them to possible scams, grooming attempts, or abuse in real time.
Background

### The Problem
Social media platforms host millions of conversations daily, but not all are safe. Many users—especially teenagers, children, and older adults—are at risk of online manipulation, grooming, and harassment. Current moderation tools are limited in their ability to understand nuance, context, and subtle manipulation.

### How Common Is It?

    Online grooming and manipulation are growing concerns.

    Hate speech remains a persistent problem on all major platforms.

    Many users are unaware they’re being targeted until it’s too late.

### Personal Motivation
Having seen how easily users can be targeted online, especially those who aren't tech-savvy, I wanted to develop a tool that offers real-time protection and awareness. The goal is to create something that proactively supports users, not just reactively moderate content after harm is done.

### Why This Topic Matters
This project is about safety, awareness, and education in the digital space. By offering intelligent assistance and alerts, we can empower users to recognize dangerous interactions and take control of their online experience.
Data and AI Techniques

### Data Sources
The project could rely on several existing and well-researched datasets, including:

    Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset (Davidson et al.)

    Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset (Kaggle)

    Online grooming detection datasets

    Social media datasets with labeled manipulative or predatory content

### AI Techniques

    Natural Language Processing (NLP) with transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa)

    Sentiment analysis for tone evaluation

    Intent classification to detect manipulation or persuasion tactics

    Multi-label classification to separate hate, grooming, scam, and criticism

    Optionally integrating real-time toxicity APIs like Perspective API

Potential Demo
A simple Python script or web app could demonstrate classification of text inputs into categories. Using tools like Hugging Face Transformers, one could build an initial proof of concept capable of detecting basic harmful messages.

### How It’s Used

Target Users

    Younger users (13–25) active on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Discord, and Reddit

    Older users who may be less experienced with identifying digital manipulation or scams

    Platform moderators or developers looking for smart moderation tools to integrate into their services

Context of Use
SentinelBot is intended to be deployed in several ways:

    As a browser extension for platforms like Reddit, Discord, or Facebook, providing real-time alerts and blocking features

    As a plugin or backend service that platforms like YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram could adopt to improve comment and DM moderation

    As an API that app developers or content platforms can embed into their systems to analyze and flag harmful messages automatically

    With user-facing feedback like: “This message may be manipulative” or “Warning: possible grooming behavior detected”

The goal is to blend seamlessly into platforms users already rely on, without disrupting their experience unless a risk is detected.

### Challenges

    False Positives: Humor, sarcasm, role-playing, or strong opinions could be misunderstood by the model.

    Privacy and Ethics: Monitoring private messages could raise privacy concerns 

    Constantly Changing Language: New slang, coded language, and manipulation tactics typically evolve rapidly.

    Adoption by Platforms: Gaining the cooperation of major platforms like YouTube or TikTok might prove to be complicated

### Possible Next Steps

Future Development:

    Fine-tune models specifically on grooming, scam, and gaslighting language

    Build a fully functioning browser extension

    Develop platform-level integrations with open APIs

    Partner with nonprofits, educators, or digital rights groups to support vulnerable communities

Potential Features:

    Long-term sentiment tracking (for gradual manipulation detection)

    A "confidence level" indicator showing how certain the model is about a threat

    Educational tips for users on how to respond or report manipulation attempts
